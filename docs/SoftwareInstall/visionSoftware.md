# Vision Software Install
There are two vision software systems used in FRC.  The most commonly used is the **LimeLight** software, which is maintained by the [LimeLight](https://limelightvision.io) vendor and uses LEDs to identify the target.  There is also an open-source software option that can be used with either a USB or RaspberryPi camera called **PhotonVision**.
