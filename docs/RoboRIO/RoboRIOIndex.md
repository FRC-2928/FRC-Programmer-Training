# Introduction
This section provides training on robots that are powered by the [roboROI](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-introduction.html#roborio-introduction) processor.  Our team has two roboRIO robots that we use for training purposes.  The first one consists of just the drivetrain and can be used for learning about the basic robot program structure and motion control.  The second one includes several other mechanisms on top of the drivetrain, which demonstrate how those subsystems get incorporated into the overall robot system.
