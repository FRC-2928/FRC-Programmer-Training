# Introduction
This section provides training on robots that are powered by the [roboROI](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-introduction.html#roborio-introduction) processor.  Our team has two roboRIO robots that we use for training purposes.  The first one consists of just the drivetrain and can be used to learn about the basic roboRIO program structure and motion control.  The second one includes several other mechanisms that are attached to the drivetrain.  This is useful to demonstrate how those subsystems get incorporated into the overall robot system.
