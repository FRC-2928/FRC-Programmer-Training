# Introduction
This section provides training on robots that are powered by the [roboROI](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-introduction.html#roborio-introduction) processor.  Our team has two roboRIO robots that we use for training purposes.  The first one is a *Differential Drive* (SweetPants) that can be used to learn about the basic roboRIO program structure and motion control.  The second one is a *Swerve Drive* (HotPants), which is a more advanced drivetrain system.

You'll also learn how to control the robots using *DriverStation*.
