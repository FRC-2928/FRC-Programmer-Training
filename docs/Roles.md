# Mentor and Student Roles

Our roles as a mentors is to guide you in what you need to know to become good robotics programmers.  We'll give you a learning path that starts out assuming that you know nothing about robotics and will build up to some pretty advanced concepts.  By the time you graduate here you'll know most of the material that would normally be taught in a first year college level robotics course.  So I'll start out by doing a 10-15 minute talk on what we will be working on in that session.  Along the we'll point you to resources for each concept and subject that you need to know.

Your jobs as a student is to go and learn the material.
To be a good programmer you need to be a good self learner.  So the more that you learn by yourself the better you will become and more subjects we can get to.  Just in the programming area alone there's almost an endless amount that you can learn.
