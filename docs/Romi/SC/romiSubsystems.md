# Subsystems

Subsystems are the basic units of functionally for our robot, such as drive trains and mechanical arms.  They encapsulate low-level hardware objects (motor controllers, sensors, etc) and provide methods that can be used by Commands.  We represent subsystems in code by using [Objects](../../Programming/objects.md). Objects are composed of [Data Structures](../../Programming/dataStructures.md) and [Procedures](../../Programming/procedures.md), as explained in [Introduction to Programming](../../Programming/introProgramming.md). You should learn those concepts before we look at the subsystems that are on the Romi.  

 For this module the majority of the code implementation can be found in the [Subsystems](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/subsystems.html) section of the FRC Documentation.

## DriveTrain Subsystem
The Romi uses a drive train called a [Differential Drive](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/actuators/wpi-drive-classes.html#using-the-differentialdrive-class-to-control-differential-drive-robots). There are three types of Differential [Drive Train Modes](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/actuators/wpi-drive-classes.html#drive-modes) that can be implemented. The Romi will make use of at least two of them. To understand what type of maneuvers are possible using a Differential Drive robots you can look at the [Robot Kinematics](../../Concepts/Dynamics/kinematics.md) module. The *DifferentialDrive* class takes the left and right motors as parameters that are wrapped in the *PWMSpeedController* class.  The primary task of the *DifferentialDrive* class is to convert a single speed (unicycle model) into speed for the left and right side of the chassis.

The primary job of the *Drivetrain* subsystem is to send speed commands to its motors.  This is done in the `arcadeDrive()` method where we pass in the required translational and rotational speed.  The *DifferentialDrive* object will take care of controlling the speed to the left and right motors based on the kinematics of the drivetrain type. 

    public void arcadeDrive(double xaxisSpeed, double zaxisRotate) {
        m_diffDrive.arcadeDrive(xaxisSpeed, zaxisRotate);
      }

Other procedures in the Drivetrain class will take care of resetting and reading the wheel encoders.  It'll also translate the wheel encoder values into distances, as explained in the [Pose Estimation](../../Concepts/OptimalEstimation/poseEstimation.md) module.  Also checkout [Using the WPILib Classes to Drive your Robot](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/actuators/wpi-drive-classes.html?highlight=speedcontroller#multi-motor-differentialdrive-with-speedcontrollergroups) for more information on implementing a drive train in FRC.

## RomiGyro Subsystem
The RomiGyro subsystem reads values from its gyro in order to perform [Pose Estimation](../../Concepts/OptimalEstimation/poseEstimation.md). The raw data that comes from gyros is very complex and difficult to intepret.  The RomiGyro subsystem translates the data into simple angles and rates-of-turn that are much easier to understand.

## Lab - Subsystems
This lab builds on the lab that you did in the [Basic Robot Structure](romiStructure.md) section of the training guide.  You'll learn about the following Java programming concepts:

- [Java Objects](../../Programming/objects.md) are programming constructs used to represent physical objects and ideas in the real world.

- [Java Constructors](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_constructors.asp) special methods that are used to initialize objects.

- [Java Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp), are declared within a class, and are used to perform certain actions.

- [Abstract Classes](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp) that show only essential things to the user and hides the internal details.  Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

- [Interfaces](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_interface.asp), which are used to group together related methods that specify the behavior of a class.

There are two updates for this lab:

- Create a method to get the current heading of the robot.
- Add comments to divide the *Drivetrain* class into subsections.

### <a name="heading"></a>Create Heading Method
In later programs we're going to need to get the current heading of our robot.  The heading is obtained from the *RomiGyro* class.  The *RomiGyro* is defined as a subsystem of the *Drivetrain* class.

Update the *Drivetrain* class with a new method called `getHeading()` that will be used to get the current heading of the robot.  You can place this method at around line `132` of the *Drivetrain* class just after the `getGyroAngleZ()` method.  The method will return a `Rotation2d()` value and be defined as `public`.  When you're done it should look like this:

    public Rotation2d getHeading() {
        return new Rotation2d(getGyroAngleZ() * (Math.PI/180));
    }

We're now done creating our new heading method!

<!-- ### Use the `this.` Syntax for Member Variables
In most of the code examples used by WPILib the member variables are denoted by using the `m_` syntax.  Our team uses the `this.` convention so we'll change our code accordingly.  This will give you a chance to learn the *Replace* function in the VSCode editor.

Open the *Drivetrain* class and select one of the occurences of `m_` with the mouse. Make sure that you only select those two characters. Then right mouse click and select *Change All Occurences*.  Type `this.` to replace all occurences of `m_`.  You'll see a whole bunch of errors.  This is because the `this.` keyword cannot be used when you first define the member variable.  To fix this, remove the `this.` from all the lines 20 through 36.

Repeat this process for all of the other files. -->

### <a name="addComments"></a>Add Comments
As you add functionality to your code some of the files may get quite long, so it's a good idea to divide them into sections by using comment separators.  In the *Drivetrain* class we'll add the following comment separators to group together methods that are logically related.  This will make them easier to find.  The comment sections will be:

- **Initialization** - Includes everything required to construct and initialize the *Drivetrain* object.
- **Control Output** - Any method that causes the robot, or subsystem, to react in some way.
- **Sensor Input** - Methods that give information on the current state of the *Drivetrain*.
- **Process Logic** - Mostly logic that occurs during the `periodic()` loop, or processes/interprets incoming data before performing some kind of *Control Output* to the robot.  Incoming data will normally be provided by methods found in the *System State* subsection.

The comments will span most of the line width to form a separator and will look like this:

    // -----------------------------------------------------------
    // System State
    // -----------------------------------------------------------

Think about where these file separators will go and what code will go in each section.  Here are a couple tips:

- If a method is returning a value, such as `double`, then it's most likely describing the Sensor Input.

- If a method return type is declared as `void` then it's probably some kind of Control Output.

That's all for this update!
