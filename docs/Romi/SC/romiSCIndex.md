# Introduction
The [Romi Robot](https://www.pololu.com/product/4022) is designed to be used as a teaching tool for programming teams involved in the <i>First Robotics Competition (FRC)</i>.  The following tutorials make use of the Romi Robot to teach beginning and intermediate programming.  By the time you finish the tutorials you will have a firm grasp on how to program robots, and the code that you develop will translate almost directly over to programming the robots used for FRC.

The Subsystems and Command modules are the starting point for the programmer training with the Romi Robot.  After setting up the development environment we use a code example supplied by WPI to get the robot up and running. This example serves as a starting point upon which to build additional functionality.
