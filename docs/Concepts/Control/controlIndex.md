# Introduction
Control is the process of converting intensions into actions.  It's used to move a robot within its environment and enable it to interact with that environment.  To achieve that we need to understand how to design control systems which take advantage of the [Dynamics](../Dynamics/dynamicsIndex) of our robot, rather than work against them.

There are several control techniques for robotics, which we'll examine in this section.

- [Classical Control](classicalControl)
- [State Space Control](stateSpaceControl)
- [Optimal Control LQR](LQR)
<!-- - [Model Predictive Control](MPC) -->
